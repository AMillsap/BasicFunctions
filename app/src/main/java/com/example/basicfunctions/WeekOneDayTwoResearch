Question 1: A hashmap is non synchronized while a hashtable is. A hashtable doesn't allow for any
            null key or values while a hashmap can have one.

Question 2: You do this so that both methods act properly on hash-based collections. The collections
            are organized in a sequence where the same hash code determines where objects go and
            where to find them.

Question 3: The factory method is about letting the subclasses determine which class to instantiate.
            It is designed to use new operations, not new classes.

Question 4: Java garbage collection is an automatic collector and destroy of objects not in use or
            unreachable. You can make a variable unreachable by nullifying the reference variable,
            re-assigning the reference variable, or if the object is created inside method.

Question 6: A sparse array is an array that has multiple locations in it filled with O or no data.

Question 7: Array is fixed length while ArrayList has a variable length. ArrayLists can't store
            primitives, only objects while Arrays can store either.

Question 8: Comparable is used to sort the objects with natural ordering while a comparator is used
            to sort attributes of different objects. Comparable compares itself with the specific
            object. The comparator compares two different class objects given to it.
